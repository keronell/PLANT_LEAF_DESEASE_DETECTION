# print a table of all types of desease and plants 


#   create a list of base augmentations that were performed and the list of augmentation in the "...with_augmentations" dataset
#   compare the results
#   adjust the "from field" image dataset 
#   find a way to improve basic model results on the "from field" images




# insert Plant_doc dataset for validation 
# run validation test on base model (that gave 99% accuracy)                            -   DONE (partly)
# show that the result of the model is much lower than initial one                      -   DONE (partly)

#   EfficientNet perfomed better on the dataset without_augmentations but perfomed slightly worse on the dataset with_augmentations
#   ViT perfomed worse on the dataset without_augmentations but improved alot on the data with_augmentations
